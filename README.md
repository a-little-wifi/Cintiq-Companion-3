# Cintiq Companion 3

I have a dead Cintiq 13HD (pen+touch) that won't display anything. I know the lcd works, tested it in my Cintiq Companion, so the board must be dead. I wanna make a new one, that you can build a computer into, or with USB-C maybe. 

Wacom made a tablet PC based on the 13HD called the Cintiq Companion, then they made a Cintiq Companion 2, so this will be the Cintiq Companion 3.
